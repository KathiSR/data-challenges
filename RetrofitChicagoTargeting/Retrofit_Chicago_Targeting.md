#DSSG Data Challenge: Improving the Effectiveness of Publically-funded Energy Efficiency Programs by Identifying by Targeting Areas and Buildings with the Greatest Need

###Project Description

The City of Chicago is engaged in a major initiative called Retrofit Chicago aimed at reducing energy waste and lowing energy bills for Chicago Residents

Low income residents are disproportionately effected by energy waste. Low income households in Chicago pay up to a quarter of their total takehome earnings in energy costs. Helping them save on energy means they have more to spend on food, healthcare, and education for their kids.

####Objectives

Help the City of Chicago's Retrofit Chicago initiative understand and improve the effectiveness of energy efficiency retrofit programs by:

- Describe the energy efficiency potential
- Predict with homes and areas are most likely to have the greatest energy efficiency potential and 
- Proscribe a list of target homes that weights energy efficiency potential and social impact (savings on bills as a percentage of income)
