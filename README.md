DSSG Data Challenges
===============

Data Challenges are real-world data challenges faced by organizations that can be solved using real data. The primary purpose of a data challenge is to provide a motivating example for the project-based learning enironment at DSSG. The secondary outcome is that solutions developed while working on the challenge can be implemented by local partners to improve their programs.
